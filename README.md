This my neovim config.

To use this, you can download files to your customized path or run the following one-line command:

```bash
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HCY-ASLEEP/NVIM-Config/main/nvim-config.sh | sh
```

To install latest nodejs of coc.nvim in China, you can run the following one-line command, but before running the command I strongly recommand switching to a non-root user first:

```bash
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HCY-ASLEEP/NVIM-Config/main/coc-nodejs-installer.sh | sh
```
